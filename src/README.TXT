--------------------------
* Fixed positioning of cord so line is not visible
* Moved to Visual basic for dos
* Added command line argument "-retest" to force code to retest machine speed for animation speed
* Added line commands to cover image corruption after walking between rooms
* Improved error handling
* Prevented mouse x and y from reaching 0
* Preload the cursors at start, no need to draw and capture everytime.
